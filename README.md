# Quora_Question_Pairs_Classification
This project focuses on classifying question pairs from the Quora platform using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to determine whether two given questions are duplicates or not.

# Problem Statement
The problem is to build a model that can accurately classify pairs of questions as either duplicate or non-duplicate. Given two input questions, the model should predict a binary label indicating whether the questions are duplicates or not. This task is crucial for platforms like Quora to improve search results, eliminate redundancy, and enhance user experience.

# Dataset
